# ProblemSetGenerator
A NodeJS web service that generates unique problem sets with variable parameters.

## Purpose
Problem sets given for practice are often static, unchanging. However, in order to be confident in their understanding, students need repetition in practice. Solving the same problem, with the same numbers, may seem unengaging. This web service will generate problem sets based on given problem sets and parameters.
